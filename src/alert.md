#### COVID-19 Updates ####

In accordance to modified Phase 2 guidelines by Ontario public health officials, equipment collection and donation due to COVID-19 has been suspended. We have been closely monitoring the COVID-19 progression and Ottawa city guidelines and have determined this course of action will be taken to prioritize the safety of both our members, donors, and community. We will, however, still continue to collect donation forms for when our recollection activities resume. Please refer to our website and social media for any potential updates on this matter.

We encourage everyone to stay informed on how to keep yourself and others safe during this time.

If you are interested in supporting our organization by other means, monetary donations will be accepted on our website and would be greatly appreciated. To send a monetary donation please visit the link below:
